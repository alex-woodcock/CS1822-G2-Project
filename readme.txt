CONTROLS
'A' to move left
'D' to move right
'space' to jump
'F' to shoot

NEED TO DO LIST:
BASIC MECHANICS
platforms
jumping - jump height will be fixed, player descends too slowly atm
enemies - zombie will go towards player and not fall off platform



ALEX Woodcock <lmao we cant even do alex W since theres 2 alex Ws 
Shooting - 
Enemies need to die when they are killed (animation/just make them flash and disappear?)
	REMOVE FROM LIST OF SPRITES? OR INVALIDATE FOR COLLISION ETC
Bullets need to go where pointed (might need to properly organise the code for this one)
Bullet disappears when its shot someone (might be tricky since its the enemy that responds to the bullet, not the other way around... Plus, the bullets are held in a list. Can they even be deleted like that without risking deleting a random bullet? Tricky stuff)
Player must take only 1 attack (Invulnerability timers? seems like the way to go, or maybe not-attacking timers for the enemies if the team doesnt go for that)



NEXT STAGE
animating sprites
life system



EXTRA STUFF (for once the basic stuff is done)
Sounds
