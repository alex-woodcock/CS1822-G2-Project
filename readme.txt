Shooting - 
---Enemies need to die when they are killed (animation/just make them flash and disappear?) x DONE
	REMOVE FROM LIST OF SPRITES? OR INVALIDATE FOR COLLISION ETC
---Bullets need to go where pointed (might need to properly organise the code for this one) x DONE
---Bullet disappears when its shot someone (might be tricky since its the enemy that responds to the bullet, not the other way around... Plus, the bullets are held in a list. Can they even be deleted like that without risking deleting a random bullet? Tricky stuff) x DONE
Player must take only 1 attack (Invulnerability timers? seems like the way to go, or maybe not-attacking timers for the enemies if the team doesnt go for that)
