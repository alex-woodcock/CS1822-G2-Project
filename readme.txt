CONTROLS
'A' to move left
'D' to move right
'space' to jump
'F' to shoot

NEED TO DO LIST:
BASIC MECHANICS
platforms
jumping - jump height will be fixed, player descends too slowly atm
enemies - zombie will go towards player and not fall off platform

Shooting - 
Enemies need to die when they are killed (animation/just make them flash and disappear?)
Bullets need to go where pointed (might need to properly organise the code for this one)

NEXT STAGE
animating sprites
life system



EXTRA STUFF (for once the basic stuff is done)
Sounds
